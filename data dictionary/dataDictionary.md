Choose the English-preferred (English-P) value if different from the overall preferred value. Give enough context that,the place information can be determined internationally (see examples).  <br><br>  However, for local place names (ex: ISU campus), you may use LCSH if established term exists, or generate local controlled term. Use local controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency in location specific to campus and Ames. Follow local syntax and punctuation practices. List place strings hierarchically in ascending order of granularity (least specific to most specific) if using LCSH. | Yangtze River *[use English-preferred values for places known in multiple languages]*  <br><br>  Paris, France  <br><br>  Chicago, Illinois  <br><br>  United States--Iowa--Ames--Iowa State University *[established LCSH heading, listed in local controlled vocabulary]*                                                                                                 | Cataloging & Metadata Unit                                                              |
