ContentDM Metadata Templates
============================

These metadata templates serve as examples of what metadata is initially entered for a digital collection project at ISU. The core metadata template ([csv](./simpleObject_coreMetadataTemplate.csv), [xlsx](./simpleObject_coreMetadataTemplate.xlsx)) lists all of the core fields that are required for a project. The typical metadata template ([csv](./typicalMetadataTemplate.csv), [xlsx](./typicalMetadataTemplate.xlsx)) lists the metadata fields that were used for the first project in which we implemented the data dictionary, which includes both core and optional (additional) metadata fields.

Guidelines and instructions for consistent use of these metadata fields are documented in our [data dictionary](../data%20dictionary/).
